# Huff - A Huffman Coding CLI tool in Rust

Huff is a small Rust program that encodes text files using [Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding), like a much more simplified version of [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip).

The easiest way to run Huff is with [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) installed. An example is provided that can be ran with `cargo run -- example.txt`.
